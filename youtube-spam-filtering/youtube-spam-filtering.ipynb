    "Precision tells us how many times an outcome was actually positive after it was predicted to be positive. Recall us tells out of actual positive data, how many times instances were predicted correctly. Recall is more important than precision when the cost of acting is low, but the opportunity cost is high. In this case, if a spam comment (positive case) is left undetected and and isn't categorized as spam, it's not such a big deal. However, if a comment is not spam (negative case), then it must not be categorized as spam. So for this spam detection, precision is more important than recall."

Hackers In Korea may have loved it so much they rised it to 2billion  hits to make it more popular.  4. The song was featured in a just dance game, on multiple mp3s, and been  seen on concerts and even on new years eve event in 2012, so just by seeing  those you mabey adding more hits to this video. 5.

I live with my dad. my mom passed  away when i was 6 so i don't really have a mother figure. I have 2 brothers  who is older than me. Since they are boys they get the attention while i  just be alone. I really want to wear pretty clothes like the girls in my  school and get a boyfriend. i just can't be my self. im very quite and shy  at school because i don't have the confidence in myself to talk to someone.  i did have one friend name Caroline but she moved away so now im alone. if  you could donate some money to me it would be great. i don't care about  expensive brand ill just shop at walmart because they have pretty clothes.  also i wanna get my nails done at a salon . i see alot of girls have these  french tips. i never had my nail did at a salon before i will really  appreciate if i can and get my hair curled too. http://www.gofundme.com/dressprettyonce thanks omg please.\\ufeff\",\n",
